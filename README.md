# Pub Standards Branding

Back in the earliest days of Pub Standards there was a [contest](http://www.flickr.com/groups/73803341@N00/) to come up with some branding for the original PS website. Over time this logo found its way onto [t-shirts](http://www.flickr.com/photos/42234748@N00/1335572592/) and then as Pub Standards spread across the world with chapters in Dublin, Cork, San Francisco, Lancaster, Vancouver as well as London, the original primitive logo ended up on numerous websites and twitter feeds. But whilst these sites shared their branding, they didn’t have anything to differentiate themselves from the other Pub Standards events in different cities. 

## The new logo

The original logo was designed by [Ben Darlow](http://www.kapowaz.net/); once the various international chapters sprang up, attempts were made to incorporate some local flavour into variant logos, but unsatisfied with the results eventually this ended up expanding in scope to encompass a redesign of the logo. As individual output files are finished, they’ll be hosted here.

### Terms of Use

You are free to use these design resources for:

* Pub Standards websites, twitter avatars etc.
* Printed flyers (if you make one of these, let us know!)

Please don’t:

* Redistribute these originals, or modified versions
* Use them in some weird, skewed aspect ratio that’d make them look rubbish.

## Logo Types

Each logo is available here as a Photoshop document, with the following variants:
